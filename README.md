Code for modeling pre-synaptic and post-synaptic heterogeneity in the expression of short term plasticity. 
It relates to the article "Synapse specific and plasticity-regulated AMPAR mobility tunes synaptic integration" by Nowacka et al.

STPfcts is a package containing subscripts. It uses the SRP model developed in Rossbroich et al. 2021 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008013
and the computational suite described in Poirier et al. 2025 "Computational protocol for modeling and analyzing synaptic dynamics using SRPlasticity" https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xpro.2025.103652

Figure_Heatmap is used to generate the heatmap and the average spectral entropy.

Figure_OneCond is used to generate sample traces of post-synaptic responses across different neurons.
